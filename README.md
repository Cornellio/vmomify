# vmomify

This is an empty skeleton for a new tool which will use the pyvmomi Python module from VMWare to interact with VMWare VSphere servers. This is intended to replace my [vmtools](https://github.com/Cornellio/vmtools) package that got stuck with an abandoned Python library.

## Goals

Key capabilities will target the preparation of machines for Kickstart deployments, including:

* List VMs
* Provision or clone VM
* Lookup VM MAC address
* Boot VM
* Report summary VM information
